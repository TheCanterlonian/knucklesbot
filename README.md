knucklesbot but in C#


seriously, who writes something and leaves NO COMMENTS anywhere?
    
    
    
    a motherfucker, that's who


yes, i literally rewrote the entire thing from scratch because i couldn't read it





i'm honestly just joking about the "motherfucker" bit, you seem cool, i just wish you'd documented your work



todo:
figure out what keeps the program from asking the user for a token before crashing
this bug forces the user to manually copy their token into the token file and
is very annoying to work with
